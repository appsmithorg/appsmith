<div align="center"><h3>Create apps by connecting UI widgets to any database and writing any logic in JS.</h3>

![UI Builder Demo](https://github.com/appsmithOrg/appsmith/blob/master/static/demo.gif)
</div>

### Here's how you build something:
1. Compose a page using pre-built UI components like table, charts, map viewers and forms.	
2. Connect the UI components to any REST API or databases like MySQL, Postgres, and MongoDB. Write any logic in JS.	
3. Deploy the internal tool to a custom URL and invite users to sign in with their Google accounts.

## üòá Why Appsmith?

When we build internal tools today, we turn to admin panels, UI frameworks or use a bootstrap theme. We took inspirations from the best admin panels, bootstrap themes, and brought back the easy UI builder of Visual Basic.

Appsmith is a quicker way of building internal tools by visualising them as modular blocks (**Widgets, APIs, Queries, JS**) and giving developers a simple user interface to configure them. Building new features, creating UI, changing dataflows, and modifying business logic becomes a [piece of cake](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/355/125/5ca.png) because you no longer have to trudge through large undocumented code bases or wrestle with HTML/CSS. 
Appsmith doesn't take the fun out of coding, because it treats every block as an object and exposes it via javascript so that you can read, transform and manipulate it. Whether it's a widget, API or query, you get to decide where you need to configure using UI and where you need to code.

## üè≠ Features

* **5 minute setup**: Deploy Appsmith on your servers in 5 minutes.
* **Build custom UI**: Drag & drop, resize and style widgets **without HTML / CSS**.
* **Query data**: Query & update your database directly from the UI. Connect to **postgres, mongo, MySQL, REST & GraphQL APIs**.
* **JS Logic**: Write snippets of business logic using JS to transform data, manipulate UI or trigger workflows. Use popular libraries like lodash & moment anywhere in the app
* **Data Workflows**: Simple configuration to create flows when users interact with the UI.
* **Realtime Editor**: Changes in your application reflect instantly with every edit. No need to compile!
* **Works with existing, live databases**: Connect directly to any Postgres, MySQL, & Mongo db
* **Fine-grained access control**: Control who can edit / view your applications from a single control panel
* **App management**: Build and organise multiple applications on a single platform
