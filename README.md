-----------------
Appsmith is a fast, easy and secure way to build and maintain internal tools. Appsmith helps you build custom UI [**without HTML/CSS**], connect to your **APIs / databases** and securely share your applications. 
The user interface is designed to make config customisation easy while allowing you to write code whenever logic is involved.

## Why Appsmith?

If we're building an internal tool, our obvious choices are to use an admin panel or if we happen to be blessed with HTML/CSS skills, we might **"bootstrap"** a new project. While this may seem like a great idea at first, internal tools almost always require a ton of iterations and eventually we reach a point where we're either spending a lot of time customising the admin panel or the UI terrifies users so much, they prefer [holding our hand](https://giphy.com/gifs/agentm-agent-m-1gg6pvaqHBv56/fullscreen) every time they try to use it.

Appsmith provides a better way of building internal tools by visualising them as modular blocks (**Widgets, APIs, Queries, JS**) and giving developers a simple user interface to configure them. With appsmith updating UI, changing dataflows and modifying business logic becomes a [piece of cake](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/355/125/5ca.png) because you no longer have to trudge through large undocumented code bases or **fight with HTML/CSS**. We understand that while some configurations are static and are better controlled via UI, a lot of it is dynamic and should be configured through code. Appsmith doesn't take the fun out of coding, instead it treats every block as an object and exposes it via javascript so that you can read, transform and manipulate it. Whether it's a widget, API or query, you get to decide where you need to configure and where you need to code.
