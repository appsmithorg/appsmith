 * This class represents the JSON schema versions those are supported for the current instance. Whenever we run the
 * migration which is going to affect the underlying DB structure for different collection used in the JSON file, we
 * have to increment the corresponding version here by 1 unit. We have 2 different fields for client and server to
 * address the issue of linear incremental migration on both server and client side as both run their own migrations.
 * Having said that during import server will have to check the compatibility for both client
 * (widget dsl) and server-side resources, so that imported application will be in sane state after import is successful
