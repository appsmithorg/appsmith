# Spacing

Spacing is a crucial aspect of design that can make or break the user
experience. It helps to create a visual hierarchy, improve readability,
and make elements of a design easier to understand. A well-thought-out
spacing system can add clarity and consistency to a design.

## Types of Spacing

There are two types of spacing in design systems: inner spacing and
outer spacing.

### Inner Spacing

Inner spacing, also known as **padding**, is the space between an
element's content and its border. It creates room for the content to
breathe and makes the element more visually appealing.

### Outer Spacing

Outer spacing, also known as **margin** and **gap**, is the space
between elements. It creates a visual separation between elements and
contributes to the overall balance of a design.

## Tokens Table

export const Spacing = () => {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  const { spacing } = theme;
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <TokenTable prefix="spacing" tokens={spacing}>
        {(cssVar) => (
          <StyledLinePreview
            style={{
              width: cssVar,
            }}
          />
        )}
      </TokenTable>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

<Spacing />
