# Root Unit

## What is it?

We use a fluid root unit to create baseline grid for our design to
ensure visual consistency and rhythm. The baseline grid is one of the
most essential layout structures in product design. It makes interfaces
more consistent, balanced, and easier to scan by users, as it
establishes a repetitive pattern in visual recognition for your users.

## How to use it?

To establish a grid system, ensure all sizes, spacing (margins, padding)
and typography in your designs are multiples of root Unit. As simple as
that.

## Why fluid?

We use fluid root unit since the smaller the size of the user viewport,
the higher the interface density should be, so we change the value of
the root unit depending on viewport.

**Important**
We do not use root unit value directly for creating components, but only
derived values are based on it such as spacing, sizing and typography.

## Value

export const RootUnit = () => {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  const { rootUnit } = theme;
  return <p>{rootUnit}</p>;
};

<RootUnit />
