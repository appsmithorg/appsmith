# Color

WDS generates a full harmonious color scheme used in Widgets from a single color input `seed` and a set of additional props (currently only `colorMode` that can be `dark` or `light`).

Colors are generated in [OkLCh](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/) color space using [color.js](https://colorjs.io/docs/spaces#oklch) to ensure perceptual uniformity when producing colors from the seed. This achieves monochromatic color harmony between UI elements.

To ensure visibility of critical UI elements we're checking key colors' conformance to [APCA](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA).

## Color token naming

Tokens are named using four-part schema. Every part of the name except `type` is optional. Suffixes describe visual function of the color in the UI.

### Type

Type defines how the color is going to be applied to UI elements.

`bg` (backgrounds) are surfaces of color.

`fg` (foregrounds) are content elements (text and icons) on top of colored surfaces. Minimal APCA contrast of `60` to satisfy accessibility requirement.

`bd` (borders) are separators. Borders can be subtle with lower contrast requirement of `25`.

<ColorTable filter={["bg-neutral", "fg-neutral", "bd-neutral"]} />

### Role

#### No role

Absence of role suffix signifies default application.

Main background color `bg` is applied to the canvas. In dark mode it is extremely dark shade of user-set seed color. In light mode it is extremely light tint of user-set seed color. This ensures harmonious combination with main accents and neutrals.

Default content color `fg` is applied to text and icons. In light mode it is dark shade of user-set seed color. In dark mode it is light tint of user-set seed color.

Focus outline `bd-focus` is applied as an outline around interactive elements when they receive keyboard-focus.

<ColorTable filter={["bg", "fg", "bd-focus"]} />

#### Accent

Accent colors indicate high prominence. They are as close to the seed as possible given accessibility requirements for their type and a requirement for `bgAccent` to be visible on top of `bg`.

<ColorTable filter={["bg-accent", "fg-accent", "bd-accent"]} />

#### Neutral

Neutral colors have less prominence than accent. Unless the seed is completely achromatic they contain small amounts of chroma to produce harmony with accents.

<ColorTable filter={["bg-neutral", "fg-neutral", "bd-neutral"]} />

#### Semaphore (positive, negative, warning)

Three roles to use for color-coding conventional types of highlights in the UI. They start from preselected values and are checked for being too similar to seed and accent. In case of a clash they are adjusted to less resemble accent colors.

<ColorTable
  filter={["bg-accent", "bg-positive", "bg-negative", "bg-warning"]}
/>

#### on\*

Used for naming foreground and border colors that are intended to be displayed on top of specific backgrounds, e.g. `onPositive`, `onAccent`.

<ColorTable
  filter={[
    "fg-on-accent",
    "fg-on-positive",
    "fg-on-negative",
    "fg-on-warning",
    "fg-on-assistive",
    "fg-on-neutral",
    "fg-on-assistive",
  ]}
/>

#### Assistive

Used for high-contrast assistive elements, e.g. a tooltip.

<ColorTable filter={["bg-assistive"]} />

### Prominence

If no prominence is specified the default looks of the color are assumed. If subtle prominence is specified less saturated and contrasting variation of color is produced.

<ColorTable
  filter={["bg-accent", "bg-accent-subtle", "bg-neutral", "bg-neutral-subtle"]}
/>

### State

#### No state

If no state is specified, a resting state of UI element is assumed.

<ColorTable filter={["bg-accent", "bg-neutral", "bg-positive"]} />

#### Hover

Slightly lighter than the resting state to produce the effect of moving closer to the viewer / inspection.

<ColorTable
  filter={["bg-accent-hover", "bg-neutral-hover", "bg-positive-hover"]}
/>

#### Active

Slightly darker than the resting state to produce the effect of moving further from the viewer / being pushed down.

<ColorTable
  filter={["bg-accent-active", "bg-neutral-active", "bg-positive-active"]}
/>
