# Opacity

Opacity is an important aspect of design system that determines the
transparency of an element. It is measured in percentage, where 0% is
completely transparent and 100% is completely opaque. In design system,
opacity is used to create visual hierarchy, depth, and contrast. By
adjusting the opacity of an element, designers can create subtle or
dramatic effects that enhance the user experience.

export const Opacity = () => {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  const { opacity } = theme;
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <TokenTable prefix="opacity" tokens={opacity}>
        {(cssVar) => (
          <StyledSquarePreview
            style={{
              opacity: cssVar,
            }}
          />
        )}
      </TokenTable>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

<Opacity />
