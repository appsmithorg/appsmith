# Entity Tabs Header

This component is designed as a companion to the `EntityExplorer` component.
It's primary use is to display the tabs that are used to navigate between different actions of the entity explorer.
This is particularly useful when IDE is in split screen mode and entity explorer is in a collapsed state.

## Anatomy

It's a flex container that accepts an arbitrary number of children.

### Default implementation

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />
