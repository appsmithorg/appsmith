# Radio

A radio input is used to allow users to select only one option from a group of choices. It is typically displayed as a part of a radio group, where only one option can be selected at a time.

### Copy

**Group labels**

- While not mandatory in our component, it is good practice to use headings to provide context or clarity for a set of radio buttons.
- Avoid redundant group labels for radio buttons if they are already part of a larger group of components with a group label. (Example?)

**Radio button labels**

- Ensure clear and concise labels for radio buttons, of not more than a few words.
