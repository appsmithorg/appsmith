# Slider

A slider component is used when you want to allow users to select a value from a range of values by dragging a thumb along a track. It is ideal for settings where a range of values is more appropriate than a fixed set of options, such as adjusting volume, brightness, or selecting a price range.

If the value represents an offset, the fill start can be set to represent the point of origin. This allows the slider fill to start from inside the track.
