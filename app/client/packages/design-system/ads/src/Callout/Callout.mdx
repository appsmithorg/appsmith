# Callout

Callouts are messages that communicate the system’s response to the user.
System response. We currently use toasts to communicate system response across the app. Callouts are typically persistent unless the user discards them. The information kind of the callout can be used to emphasize certain information on the page, even if it is technically not a system response.. in this case, it is a system’s “suggestion” rather than a response.
