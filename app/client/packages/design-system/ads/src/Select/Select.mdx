# Select

Select allows users to make single or multiple selections from a list of options, usually found in forms or inline editing.

## Anatomy

1. **Label:** Labels should indicate what information the field requires.
2. **Select field:** The field people click in to receive the options they can choose from. Once selected, the option will be shown in the field.
3. **Dropdown:** Contains the list of all selectable items.
4. **Placeholder:** Includes information that supports the field label and other contextual cues, for example, _“Start typing to see names”_.
5. **Selected item:** Displays what options have been selected. Users can remove selections by selecting the option again.
6. **Clear all:** When the `allowClear` flag is set, the **x** button clears all selections and anything else in the selection field. It only appears when at least one option has been selected.

## Best practices

The select component should:

- Be used to select from four or more pre-defined options.
- Whenever possible, have a default option selected.
- Use "Select" as a placeholder option only if there is no logical default option.

## Usage

**When to use**

- Use the select component within a form when users need to select from a list of options and submit data.
- Use the select component when the user experience is primarily form-based.

**When not to use**

- Avoid using a select component if there are fewer than three options for selection. Instead, use a radio button group.
