/**
 * Wrap a webworker to provide a synchronous request-response semantic.
 *
 * Usage on main thread:
 * w = GracefulWorkerService(Worker);
 * yield w.start(); // Start the worker
 * const workerResponse = yield w.request("my_action", { hello: "world" }); // Send a request, wait for response
 *
 * Worker will receive:
 * {
 *   method: "my_action",
 *   requestId: "<unique request id>",
 *   requestData: { hello: "world" },
 * }
 *
 * Worker is expected to respond with an object with exactly the `requestId` and `responseData` keys:
 * {
 *   requestId: "<the id it received>",
 *   responseData: 42
 * }
 * All other keys will be ignored.
 * We make no assumptions about data type of `requestData` or `responseData`.
 *
 * Note: The worker will hold ALL requests, even in case of restarts.
 * If we do not want that behaviour, we should create a new GracefulWorkerService.
