 * This hook is used to select a widget in the Anvil Layout System
 * A custom event is dispatched by all widgets on click
 * This hook listens to that event and dispatches the select action
 *
 * We throttle (and use trailing) the listener to prevent multiple dispatches, as well as to pick the latest event
 * The latest event is going to be the most deeply nested child that has triggered this event
 *
 * The maxWait value and wait values for throttle are variable, they can be adjusted according to the need
 * For now, 100ms seems like a good middle ground.
