<p>No, Appsmith does not store any data returned from your API endpoints or DB queries. Appsmith only acts as a proxy layer. When you query your database/API endpoint, the Appsmith server only appends sensitive credentials before forwarding the request to your backend. The Appsmith server doesn't expose sensitive credentials to the browser because that can lead to <ais-highlight-0000000000>security</ais-highlight-0000000000> breaches.
