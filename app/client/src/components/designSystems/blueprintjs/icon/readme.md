Note: this module is a modified copy of `@blueprintjs/core/lib/esm/components/icon/icon.js`. It provides the same API but loads BlueprintJS icons dynamically instead of bundling them with the rest of the application.

During the build process, the `@blueprintjs/core/lib/esm/components/icon/icon.js` file is aliased with this module.
