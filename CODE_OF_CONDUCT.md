# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation with an interest in fostering an open and welcoming environment.

## Our Standards

To create a positive environment we should have a positive attitude, which includes:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy towards other community members.

Some of the unacceptable behaviour by the participants includes:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for any behaviours that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing this project or its community. 
Representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by contacting the project team at support@appsmith.com. All
complaints will be reviewed, investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality concerning the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
