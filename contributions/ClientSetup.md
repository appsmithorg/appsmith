## Running Client Codebase

Appsmith's client (UI/frontend) uses the ReactJS library and Typescript. The application also uses libraries like react-redux and redux-saga for workflows. We use VS Code Editor as our primary editor.

[![How to Setup Appsmith for Client Side Development](../static/images/client-yt-video-thumbnail.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwJlVWVx0X0)

### Pre-requisites:

On your development machine, please ensure that:

1. You have `docker` installed in your system. If not, please visit: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
1. You have `mkcert` installed. Please visit: [https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation) for details. For `mkcert` to work with Firefox, you may need to install the `nss` utility. Details are in the link above.

Note:

- On Linux, you can easily install `mkcert` using the following command

```
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases/latest \
| grep "browser_download_url.*linux-amd64" \
| cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \" \
| wget -i - -O mkcert
chmod +x  mkcert
sudo mv mkcert /usr/local/bin
```

1. You have `envsubst` installed. Use `brew install gettext` on MacOS. Linux machines usually have this installed.
1. You have cloned the repo in your local machine.
1. You have yarn installed as a global npm package, i.e. `npm install -g yarn`.

### Create local HTTPS certificates:

1. Run the following command from the project root.

   ```bash
   cd app/client/docker && mkcert -install && mkcert "*.appsmith.com" && cd ../../..
   ```

   This command will create 2 files in the `docker/` directory:

   - `_wildcard.appsmith.com-key.pem`
   - `_wildcard.appsmith.com.pem`

1. Add the domain `dev.appsmith.com` to `/etc/hosts`.

   ```bash
   echo "127.0.0.1 dev.appsmith.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   ```

   Note:

   - Please be careful when copying the above string as space between the IP and the string goes missing sometimes.
   - Please check that the string is copied properly

   ```
   cat /etc/hosts | grep appsmith
   ```

1. Run cmd: `cp .env.example .env`

1. Run the script `start-https.sh` to start the Nginx container that will proxy the frontend code on your local system.

   ```bash
   cd app/client
   ./start-https.sh
   ```
   
   Note:

   - If you want to use the backend server running on your local, you do not need to pass a parameter when running `start-https.sh`. 
   - If you want to use release.app.appsmith as your backend server, please check out the section - [If you would like to hit a different Appsmith server](#if-you-would-like-to-hit-a-different-appsmith-server)

### Steps to build & run the code:

1. Run `yarn install`.

   Note:

   - On the Ubuntu Linux platform, please run the following cmd before step 2 below:

     ```
     echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
     ```

2. Run `yarn start`.

   ðŸŽ‰ Your Appsmith client is now running on https://dev.appsmith.com.

   This URL must be opened with https and not have port 3000 in it.

#### Note:

- By default, your client app points to the local API server - `http://host.docker.internal:8080` for MacOS or `http://localhost:8080` for Linux. If you don't have the API server running on your local system, your page will load with errors. To set up the API server on your local system, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/blob/release/contributions/ServerSetup.md)
- If you cannot set up the API server on your local system, you can also [use Appsmith's staging API server](#if-you-would-like-to-hit-a-different-appsmith-server).

#### If yarn start throws mismatch node version error

This error occurs because the node version is not compatible with the app environment. In this case, Node version manager can be used, allowing multiple node versions in different projects. Check below for installation and usage details:

1. Install a node version manager. For eg: check [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).
1. In the project's root, run `nvm use 16.14.0` or `fnm use 16.14.0`.

#### If you would like to hit a different Appsmith server:

- You can pass the server URL as an arg to the `start-https.sh` script.

  ```bash
  ./start-https.sh https://release.app.appsmith.com
  ```

- Run

  ```
  yarn
  yarn start
  ```

### Running Tests on Client

1. To run the Cypress integration tests, you can create a local file `app/client/cypress.env.json` to populate `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` env variables or use one of the methods [from their docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables.html#Setting).

   ```json
   {
     "USERNAME": "Enter username",
     "PASSWORD": "Enter password"
   }
   ```
2. In order to run cypress tests which use datasources/rest api, you will need to have TED container running: (It bundles multiple services together along with fake data for testing)
   ``` 
   docker pull appsmith/test-event-driver
   ```
   ```
   docker run --name appsmithted -d -p 2222:22 -p 5001:5001 -p 3306:3306 -p 28017:27017 -p 5432:5432 -p 25:25 -p 5000:5000 -p 3000:3000 -v `pwd`/git-server/keys:/git-server/keys -v `pwd`/git-server/repos:/git-server/repo appsmith/test-event-driver
   ```
   Note : You need to have client and server running locally to run TED

1. run:

```bash
  cd app/client
  yarn run test
```

Please check out our [Testing Contribution](docs/TestAutomation.md) guide for more details on setting up & troubleshooting Cypress runs on your machine.

4. To run the Jest unit tests, run:

```bash
  cd app/client
  yarn run test:unit
```

To run a single jest test,
```bash
  cd app/client
  npx jest <file_path/file_name>
```

To run a single jest test in watch mode,
```bash
  npx jest --watch <file_path/file_name>
```

### Windows WSL2 Setup

[![How to Setup Appsmith for Client Side Development in Windows](../static/images/client-wsl-yt-video-thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/Od-qic69syA)

Before you follow the instructions above, make sure to check the following steps:

1. You have **WSL2** setup in your machine. If not, please visit: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
2. You have [Node.js](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-linux/) installed on the WSL Distro.
3. You have **Docker Desktop** installed with the WSL2 backend. If not, please visit: [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/).

In the above [Docker Desktop Setup](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/) instructions, make sure to:

1. Set WSL Distro to run in WSL2 mode.
2. Enable integration with the WSL Distro in Docker Desktop.
3. Install [Remote-WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) extension in VSCode.

Make sure to Clone the Repo in the WSL file system instead of the Windows file system.

And finally, you can open the folder in VSCode with WSL by following the instructions in [Docker Desktop Setup](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/),
or by,

1. Clicking on the Green button on the Bottom Left corner in VSCode.
2. Selecting **Open Folder in WSL** and navigating to the folder in WSL.

After this, you can continue Setting up from [here](#pre-requisites).

### Troubleshooting

#### I am on WSL and can't reach dev.appsmith.com

- You will need to add `dev.appsmith.com` to Windows' `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` instead of `/etc/hosts`. Alternately, you can install a desktop environment in WSL to open `dev.appsmith.com` from a browser in WSL.

  ```
  127.0.0.1 dev.appsmith.com
  ```

- WSL network with windows can be brittle; make sure you can reach http://127.0.0.1:3000 from windows. If not, restarting wsl usually resolves the issue.

#### Docker container doesn't work

- You can check logs with `docker logs wildcard-nginx`.
- If you see `Address already in use` errors, look for the service running on port 80 and 443 with `lsof -i tcp:80,443 | grep LISTEN` and stop the process.

  **Example**: Some Linux distros have `apache2` listening on 80. Stop them with `sudo systemctl stop apache2`

#### I want to add dev.appsmith.com conf to my local Nginx without Docker.

1. Copy `app/client/docker/templates/nginx-app.conf.template` over to your nginx sites directory.
1. You can remove or replace values for all the `sub_filter`. None of those properties are required.
1. Change `proxy_pass` value for client from `__APPSMITH_CLIENT_PROXY_PASS__` to `http://localhost:3000`
1. Replace all occurrences of `__APPSMITH_SERVER_PROXY_PASS__` with `http://localhost:8080` (or the server you want to point to)
1. Generate the certificates manually via `mkcert`.
1. Change the value of the certificate location for keys `ssl_certificate` & `ssl_certificate_key` to the place where these certificates were generated.
1. Reload nginx! :tada:
