## I Overview of Appsmith Documentation

This guide shows writers how to contribute to Appsmith’s documentation. This style guide acts as a road map that is aimed to produce well-written and accessible documentation.


## II Overall Tone of Documentation

The documentation strikes a balance between friendly and professional. We avoid jargon whenever possible, and go for the most straightforward explanation.


Except for blog posts, the documentation will use the second person (you). Third-person (We) will be avoided whenever possible, in most cases, the user is not perusing the documentation with you, so no need to use “we”.


## III Passive vs. Active Voice

Voice is either active or passive. Keep it active whenever you can.

In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action.
In passive voice, the subject is the receiver of the action.

**Passive Voice Trick**

*After every verb, insert "by zombies."*

*If the sentence still makes sense, you're using ​passive voice.*

*"The story was written (by zombies)" → passive voice.*

*"She wrote (by zombies) the story." → active voice.*


## IV Avoid “easy” and “simple”

In the spirit of keeping the documentation accessible. We’ll avoid using words like “easy”, “simple”, and “basic” because this language discourages beginner programmers.  
  
These phrases also act as a short-cut and writers use them to avoid writing a clearer description of the task at hand.


## V Make Documentation Scannable

Appsmith’s documentation is scannable. Avoid word blocks whenever possible. The user should be able to obtain the information they need as quickly as possible.

Be brief, be bold, be clear

Write short headings, short sentences, and short paragraphs that are easy to read- and more visually appealing.

1. Use short, simple words.
2. Get to the point.
3. Then stop
