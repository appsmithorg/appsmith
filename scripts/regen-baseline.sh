# 1. Run a new Appsmith container.
# 2. Wait for, and ensure backend server is up.
# 3. Kill backend.
# 4. Ensure connection to the embedded MongoDB.
# 5. Run the export script against the embedded MongoDB.
# 6. If needed, move the jsonl files to the right place.
# 7. Remove the container.
#
# Unfortunately, everytime this script runs, there will be a diff in the jsonl files. Always. This is because the ObjectID
# values, and the "createdAt" values would be different everytime a new Appsmith container is started up. This is...
# _okay_ for now. Since once we passover to only writing migrations on Postgres, these files will effectively be sealed.
# So we have to put up with that "problem" only until then. Which makes it not worth our time to solve.
# That said, please carefully review the diff nevertheless, keeping in mind the implementation of the migrations that
# reads these files.
