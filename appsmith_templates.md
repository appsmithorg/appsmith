## Appsmith Example Applications and Templates

Our team and the community have created a few **example** applications that can be used as-is, or as a template that can serve as a starting point for your application.

You can use the applications for yourself following the simple steps below:

1. Click on the application of your choice
2. On the top right-hand corner, you will see an option to `fork` the application
4. Click on `fork` application 
5. Log in to Appsmith, if not already
6. Select the workspace to which the application should be forked
7. Change datasource credentials to connect to your backend
8. You now have a fully functional app to use or build on top of

### List of forkable applications on Appsmith

1. [Applicant Tracker System](https://app.appsmith.com/applications/5f43bce13697fd5df1c52ce4/pages/5f43c39c3697fd5df1c52d50)

> This application will need you to connect to your instance of Postgres, but once done, you will be able to manage the entire lifecycle of applicants in your hiring pipeline. We've also added Google Calendar API calls so you can schedule interviews directly from this application.

2. [Calendly in Appsmith](https://app.appsmith.com/applications/600186605b452f525458d6d2/pages/600186605b452f525458d6d4)


> A barebones version of calendly that you can use to schedule meetings, or just play around with how you can use APIs and Appsmith to build really powerful applications. Connects to Google Calendar API, so will need you to [authorize your OAuth2 token](https://docs.appsmith.com/core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/connect-to-apis/authentication/oauth2-authentication).

3. [Founder/Investor CRM](https://app.appsmith.com/applications/6098bdc65864501cc39c3d2f/pages/6098bdc65864501cc39c3d31)

> A pragmatic CRM that helps founders keep track of the investor conversations they have had, and details about the investor, fund and files shared. You can use it to mark the next steps and prioritize conversations. We have found this system very useful personally for our fundraises. We chose to use a Google Sheets backend as that's where founders end up keeping these notes usually. You can just [authorize a sheet](https://docs.appsmith.com/how-to-guides/oauth2-authorization-for-google-sheets) to get it working.
