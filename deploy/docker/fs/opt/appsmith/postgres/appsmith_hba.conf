# This is a custom configuration for Embedded PostgreSQL for Appsmith.
# This file will be used to override the default pg_hba.conf file on restart.

# What is the meaning of this configuration?
# This configuration changes how PostgreSQL authenticates users 
# connecting to the database. For user "postgres", we are allowing 
# all connections from all addresses without any password on the unix 
# socket. For all other users, we are allowing connections from IPv4 
# and IPv6 with a password.

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
