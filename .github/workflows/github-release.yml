name: Appsmith Github Release Workflow

# This workflow builds Docker images for server and client, and then pushes them to Docker Hub.
# The docker-tag with which this push happens is `latest` and the release tag (e.g., v1.2.3 etc.).
# This workflow does NOT run tests.
# This workflow is automatically triggered when a release is created on GitHub.

on:
  # Ref: <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#release>.
  release:
    types:
      # Unlike the `released` event, the `published` event triggers for pre-releases as well.
